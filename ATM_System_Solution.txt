==============================================================================
                        APPROACH & DESIGN DECISIONS
==============================================================================

ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH:

1. **Singleton Pattern for Bank Management**
   - Rationale: Ensure single source of truth for all banking operations
   - Implementation: Thread-safe singleton with double-checked locking
   - Benefits: Prevents multiple bank instances, ensures data consistency

2. **Account-Level Thread Safety**
   - Rationale: Support concurrent operations while maintaining data integrity
   - Implementation: Individual threading.Lock() for each account
   - Benefits: Different accounts can be accessed simultaneously, prevents race conditions

3. **FastAPI Framework Selection**
   - Rationale: Modern, fast, automatic API documentation, type hints support
   - Benefits: Built-in validation, async support, interactive documentation

4. **Router-Based Architecture**
   - Rationale: Modular code organization, separation of concerns
   - Implementation: Separate routers for different API functionalities
   - Benefits: Easier maintenance, scalable structure

5. **Configuration Management System**
   - Rationale: Support multiple deployment environments
   - Implementation: YAML-based config with environment variable overrides
   - Benefits: Easy deployment, no code changes between environments

TECHNICAL DECISIONS:

**Data Storage:**
- Decision: In-memory dictionary storage
- Rationale: Assignment requirement, simplicity, fast access
- Trade-off: No persistence (acceptable for demo)

**Input Validation:**
- Decision: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Rationale: Automatic validation, clear error messages, type safety
- Benefits: Prevents invalid data, consistent API responses

**Error Handling:**
- Decision: HTTP status codes with descriptive messages
- Implementation: 200 (success), 400 (bad request), 404 (not found)
- Benefits: RESTful design, clear error communication

==============================================================================
                           CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
==============================================================================

CHALLENGE 1: Thread Safety
Problem: Concurrent requests could cause race conditions in account operations
Solution: Implemented account-level locking with threading.Lock()
Result: Thread-safe operations while allowing concurrent access to different accounts

CHALLENGE 2: Circular Import Dependencies  
Problem: Router needed Bank access, creating circular imports
Solution: Singleton pattern allowing direct access without circular dependencies
Result: Clean architecture without import issues

CHALLENGE 3: Configuration Management
Problem: Supporting multiple environments (development/production)
Solution: YAML-based configuration with environment variable overrides
Result: Easy deployment across different environments

CHALLENGE 4: Data Initialization
Problem: Need initial account data while maintaining in-memory storage
Solution: File-based initialization that loads accounts at startup
Result: Flexible account setup while meeting in-memory requirement

CHALLENGE 5: API Consistency
Problem: Ensuring consistent response formats across endpoints
Solution: Pydantic models for standardized request/response structures
Result: Consistent, validated API responses with clear documentation

   }

==============================================================================
                         EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================================================

METHOD 1: PRODUCTION SERVER (IMMEDIATE TESTING)
The API is already deployed and running on AWS EC2 instance.

Base URL: http://56.228.41.210:8000
Documentation: http://56.228.41.210:8000/docs
Hosting: AWS EC2 Instance

Test Commands:
```bash
# Check system status
curl -X GET "http://56.228.41.210:8000/"

# Check account balance
curl -X GET "http://56.228.41.210:8000/accounts/123456/balance"

# Deposit money
curl -X POST "http://56.228.41.210:8000/accounts/123456/deposit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 250.0}'

# Withdraw money  
curl -X POST "http://56.228.41.210:8000/accounts/123456/withdraw" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100.0}'
```

METHOD 2: LOCAL INSTALLATION
1. Clone repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yuvalgorodissky/ATM_System.git
   cd ATM_System

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run application:
   python main.py

4. Access API:
   - Base URL: http://localhost:8000
   - Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

METHOD 3: INTERACTIVE TESTING
Visit the interactive API documentation at:
http://56.228.41.210:8000/docs

This provides a web interface to test all endpoints directly.

==============================================================================
                                 ACCOUNTS
==============================================================================

The system comes pre-configured with 3 accounts:

ACCOUNT 1: 123456
- Initial Balance: $1,000.00

ACCOUNT 2: 789012
- Initial Balance: $2,500.00

ACCOUNT 3: 345678
- Initial Balance: $500.00

SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS:
- Fixed account base of 3 accounts only
- Account-centric operations (focus on account numbers)
- Simple account structure for demonstration
- No user registration/management in current implementation

EXPANDABILITY:
While the current implementation focuses on account operations with pre-configured 
accounts, the system can be easily expanded to include:
- User registration and management endpoints
- Multiple accounts per user  
- User authentication and authorization
- User profile management
- Account creation workflows

The modular architecture supports these enhancements without major restructuring.
